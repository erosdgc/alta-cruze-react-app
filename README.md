# Atlas Cruzer React App - Coderhouse Project

This is an academic project on an app for cruise travel reservations.

## Features

The project features 8 different places to vacation on a cruise. It uses Firebase to get the information of each one of them, including the images which in turn are located on a 3rd party server.

### E-commerce

It uses a sort of a "Cart" with a cart widget, which counts the number of people who are going to travel.


### Categories

There are three categories, which can be found within the navbar and the footer. The ones im referring to are named as 'New', 'Special', and 'Classics'.

### Responsive Design

There are some things to fix yet, but it's navigable (mostly).

## Way to go

1. The first thing to do is selecting a cruise by clicking on its image, name, or 'learn more' button.

2. Once inside the item details, select a number of travelers.

Note: the maximum quantity of people to proceed with a booking is 4. Otherwhise, it is recommended to send an email to the corresponding address.

3. Fill out the checkout form with the buyer information.

4. At the end of the operation, the user will obtain an auto-generated number.


More features are coming soon.
